<h1>Pong</h1> 

{% toc %}

The first (and easiest) game to be made as part of the 20 games challenge is pong. 

<h2>Overview</h2>
The game is quite simple, and contains in principle only five relevant elements:

1) A left player 2) A right player, 3) A ball, 4) An upper wall, 5) A lower wall.

The (each) player controls a paddle and tries to not let the ball get past it. The upper and lower walls will bounce the ball back, as will each paddle. If the ball leaves the arena on either site, the other player will get a point.

The finished product looks, in my case, something like the following:

**Main menu screen**

**Actual ingame screen**

As we can see, there is also a simple score display counter as well as a (purely optical) divider in the middle of the "arena".

<h2> Implementation</h2>
<h3> Getting started: A new project</h3>
Alright, enough impressions. Let's get started. We make an empty Godot project that we call Pong. I use the legacy renderer for hardware reasons (my dev device is too old for the vulkan renderer), but this doesn't matter too much.

With this ready, we need to think about how we want to structure our game. My approach was to use a *main scene* that will contain and control all elements of the game and bind them together.
