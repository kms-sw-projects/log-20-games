While learning how to put together games, there is a vast amount of knowledge and "how-to:s" to sift through. I find "doing" often the best way of learning something, but over time I found some resources that I found useful for the process. This is an incomplete list of such things.

<h1> Reading material</h1>

<h2> Programming </h2>

* [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com): 

    Great book with an overview of Dos and Don'ts for game architecture / design. Free HTML version is available, printed and ebook versions can be bought. I liked the writing style a lot.

<h2> Engine-specific </h2>

* [Godot engine documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/):
    
    Pretty solid documentation of the engine. Includes some (short) tutorials how to get started with a first simple game. Good starting point into the engine.
