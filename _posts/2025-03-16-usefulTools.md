While learning how to put together games, there is a vast amount of knowledge and "how-to:s" to sift through. I find "doing" often the best way of learning something, but over time I found some resources that I found useful for the process. This is an incomplete list of such things.

<h1> Reading material</h1>

<h2> Programming </h2>

* [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com): 

    Great book with an overview of Do:s and Don't:s for game architecture / design. Free HTML version is available, printed and ebook versions can be bought. I liked the writing style a lot, plus it gave some very helpful input to me personally.

<h2> Engine-specific </h2>

* [Godot engine documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/):
    
    Pretty solid documentation of the engine in it's entirety. Includes some (short) tutorials how to get started with a first simple game. Good starting point into the engine.


<h1> Video tutorials </h1>

* [The ultimate introduction to Godot 4](https://youtu.be/nAh_Kx5Zh5Q) 

    The holy grail of video introductions. Take a few days off to watch (and practice) twelve(!) hours of introductory content. Great resource.

* [DevWorks channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSehnx-yuPok8rOWlPIGGOQ) 

    This person has a bunch of more concrete, topic-focused (and shorter) tutorials that I found highly enjoyable.

* [Nonsensical 2D](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC735U5ZCdMk_e0ycJyEjmWA) 

    It's more art related. Some discussions on different topics about 2D art, combined with great tutorials. Very helpful for someone as artistically untalented as me - give it a try if you are looking for input in this direction. He is also Swedish which makes for explanations presented with a wonderful accent.
