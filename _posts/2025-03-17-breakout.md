The third game to be made as part of the 20 games challenge is **Breakout**. You can read more about the challenge aspect of it [here](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/games/breakout/).

<h2>Overview</h2>
The game is somewhat like Pong - containing a paddle and a ball. However, 3 sides of the arena have walls that will bounce the ball back. Additionally, the arena contains a grid of bricks that bounce back the ball, but are destroyed in the process. Each time a brick is destroyed, the player receives a point. Additionally, the player has three lives and loses one each time the ball leaves the playing field via the bottom of the arena. The goal is ultimately to destory all bricks while not losing all lives. Easy!

My game looks like this:

<h2> Implementation</h2>

<h3> Getting started: A new project</h3>
To start we create an empty Godot project that we call Breakout. I use the legacy renderer for hardware reasons (my dev device is too old for the vulkan renderer).
