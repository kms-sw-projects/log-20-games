I am just a normal guy trying to learn how to build games, and the skills needed for that. Since I have a background in physics and programming, the coding part is "relavively" easy. Other parts (art, music) are more of challenge but fun to learn as well.

Maybe when sifting through this page you will find something that is useful for you. I would hope so.
