I am just a random guy trying to learn how to build games and the skills needed for that. I have a background in physics and programming so for me the coding part is "relatively" easy. Other parts (art, music) are more of challenge for me but game dev is a great motivation to practice them. 

Maybe when sifting through this page you will find something that is useful for you. I would hope so.
