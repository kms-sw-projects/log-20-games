I am just a random guy trying to learn how to build games and the skills needed for that. I have a background in physics and programming so for me the coding part is "relatively" easy. As always, the devil is of course in the details and there are things to learn the hard way. Other parts (art, music) are more of challenge for me but game dev is a great motivation to practice them. 

Maybe when sifting through this page you will find something that is useful for you. I would hope so.
